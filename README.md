# CarAutomation

## Overview

CarAutomation focused on the development and optimization of NVIDIA's end-to-end learning framework for self-driving cars. The inspiration for this project stems from NVIDIA's pioneering research paper in the field.

The primary goal of CarAutomation is to leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for predicting nuanced steering angles from diverse road images. The intricately tuned model has achieved a remarkable accuracy exceeding 92.5%, showcasing exceptional proficiency in the complex task of self-driving car automation.
